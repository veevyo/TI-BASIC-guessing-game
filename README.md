# TI-BASIC-guessing-game
![](RANDOM.gif)

A random number guessing game written for the TI-83 Plus, TI-84 Plus (and Silver Edition), TI-84 Plus C Silver Edition, and TI-84 Plus CE.
If you use a TI-83 Plus, TI-84 Plus, or a TI-84 Plus Silver Edition, upload RANDBW.8xp to your calculator. Otherwise, use RANDOM.8xp.

I have more detailed instructions on how to play TI-BASIC games on the Github page of another TI-BASIC game I wrote. You can read it here: https://github.com/veevyo/avoid-the-Os/.
